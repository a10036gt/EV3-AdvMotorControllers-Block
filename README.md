What’s EV3-AdvMotorControllers-Block？

WRO’s robots are quite “fast, ruthless and accurate”, so how to accurately control the robot is an important topic. Obviously, the built-in functions in EV3-G are far from enough for us to use.

So we have developed 5 movement blocks for the WRO Regular (Of course FLL、RCJ or any other competition can use it).
They are “PD Controller”, “Synchronous Movement Controller”, and “Acceleration-Deceleration Controller” 😍
Due to working at a lower level than my blocks, so the program is more fast and accurate.😁
